Hispanics or Latinos are persons of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central-American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race.  The federal government considers race and Hispanic origin to be two separate and distinct concepts; Hispanic Americans may be any race.
According to the 2000 U.S. Census, Hispanics of all races represent 13.3 percent of the U.S. population, about 37.4 million individuals.
The Census Bureau projects that by the year 2040 there will be 87.5 million Hispanic individuals, comprising 22.3 percent of the population.
Though Hispanic communities can be found throughout Florida, the Northeast, and other parts of the country, the greatest concentrations of Hispanics are in the southwestern states from Texas to California.  The states with the greatest concentration of Hispanics are New Mexico, California, Texas, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, and Florida.

Though they share many aspects of a common heritage such as language and emphasis on extended family, Hispanic cultures vary significantly by country of origin.
Hispanics tend to be younger than the white non-Hispanic population (except for Cubans, who have a higher proportion of elderly than other Hispanic groups).
Their health profiles are also unique: Puerto Ricans suffer disproportionately from asthma, HIV/AIDS, and infant mortality, while Mexican Americans suffer disproportionately from diabetes.
Factors that contribute to poor health outcomes among Hispanics include language and cultural barriers, lack of access to preventive care, and lack of health insurance.

This ethnic group includes any person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race. According to the 2006 U.S. Census Bureau population estimate, there are roughly 44.3 million Hispanics living in the United States. This group represents almost 15 percent of the U.S. total population. In 2004, among Hispanic subgroups, Mexicans rank as the largest at 66 percent. Following Mexicans are: Central and South Americans (13 percent), Puerto Ricans (9.4 percent), Cubans (3.9 percent) and the remaining 7.5 percent are people of other Hispanic origins. States with the largest Hispanic populations are California (13 million), Texas (8 million), New York (3 million), Florida (3.6 million), and Illinois (1.9 milion). Another significant point is that in 2004, 34.3 percent of Hispanics were under the age 18 in comparisons to 22.3 percent of non-Hispanic Caucasians. Among Hispanics, Mexicans have the largest proportion of people under age 18, at 36 percent.

A 2002 study conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center concluded that language fluency varies among Hispanic subgroups who reside within the mainland United States. The number of Hispanics who speak only English at home: 3.9 million for Mexicans, 763,875 for Puerto Ricans, 163,599 for Cubans and 1.8 million for other Hispanic/Latino groups. The number of Hispanics who speak Spanish at home: 14.5 million for Mexicans, 2.3 million for Puerto Ricans, 1 million for Cubans and 6.7million for other Hispanic/Latino groups.

According to a 2006 U.S. Census Bureau report, 55 percent of Hispanics in comparison to 85 percent non-Hispanic Caucasians have a high school diploma. 10 percent of Hispanics in comparison to 24.6 percent of non-Hispanic Caucasians have a bachelorâ€™s degree.

According to a 2004 U.S. Census Bureau report, 24.6 percent of Hispanics in comparison to 13.4 percent non-Hispanic Caucasians work within service occupations. 16.8 percent of Hispanics in comparison to 39.1 percent of Caucasians work in managerial or professional occupations. Among full-time year-round workers in 2004, 29.4 percent of Hispanics in comparison to 57.5 percent of non-Hispanic Caucasians earned $35,000 or more. According to the same 2004 study, 22.5 percent of Hispanics in comparison to 8.2 percent of non-Hispanic Caucasians were living at the poverty level. Hispanics represented 14 percent of the total U.S. population but constituted 21.8 percent of the population living in poverty.

It is significant to note that Hispanics have the highest uninsured rates of any racial or ethnic group within the United States. In 2004 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that private insurance coverage among Hispanic subgroups varied as follows: 39.1 percent of Mexicans, 47.3 percent of Puerto Ricans, 57.9 percent of Cubans, 45.1 percent of other Hispanic and Latino groups. 2004 Medicaid coverage varied among Hispanic subgroups: 22.4 percent of Mexicans, 29.1 percent of Puerto Ricans, 17.9 of Cubans, and 20.8 percent of other Hispanic or Latino groups. Those without health insurance coverage varied among Hispanic subgroups: 37.6 percent of Mexicans, 20.4 percent of Puerto Ricans, 22.8 percent of Cubans and 32.3 percent of other Hispanic or Latino groups.

Hispanic health is often shaped by factors such as language/cultural barriers, lack of access to preventive care, and the lack of health insurance. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has cited some of the leading causes of illness and death among Hispanics, which include heart disease, cancer, unintentional injuries (accidents), stroke, and diabetes. Some other health conditions and risk factors that significantly affect Hispanics are: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, HIV/AIDS, obesity, suicide, and liver disease.

Hispanics have higher rates of obesity than non-Hispanic Caucasians. There are also disparities among Hispanic subgroups. For instance, while the rate of low birth weight infants is lower for the total Hispanic population in comparison to non-Hispanic Caucasians, Puerto Ricans have a low birth weight rate that is 50 percent higher than the rate for non-Hispanic Caucasians. Also Puerto Ricans also suffer disproportionately from asthma, HIVAIDS and infant mortality. Mexican-Americans suffer disproportionately from diabetes.

Although Hispanic children aged 19 to 35 months had comparable rates of immunization for hepatitis, influenza, MMR, and polio, they were slightly less likely to be fully immunized, when compared to non-Hispanic white children.

In 2004, infant mortality rates for Hispanic subpopulations ranged from 4.6 per 1,000 live births to 7.8 per 1,000 live births, compared to the non-Hispanic white infant mortality rate of 5.7 per 1,000 live births.
