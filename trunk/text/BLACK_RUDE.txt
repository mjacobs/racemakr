Contrary to media depictions, I would argue that blacks are weak-willed. They are the only race that has been enslaved for 300 years.

THE KKK IS GETTING BIGGER GRAB A BAT AND BEAT A NIGGER

i just hate black people. i hate the fact that there's too many of them. i hate that they're so good at sports. i hate it that they're all damn criminals. as a matter of fact i hate everything black. I hate every black bastard, I hate black skin.
Most of all, I hate that black-ass Wesley Snipes.

now, all these blacks take all the big butts for themselves, so that honest, hard working americans like me get NOTHING.

I hate the black girls at my school because they're obnoxious and loud and act so aggressive and if you even dare to look at them they'll make a huge scene.
