Blacks or African Americans are  people having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa.
Those who identify only as African American constitute approximately 12 percent of the American population -- almost 35 million individuals, according to the 2000 U.S. Census.
The Census Bureau projects that by the year 2035 there will be more than 50 million African American individuals in the United States, comprising 14.3 percent of the population. 
The African American population is represented throughout the country, with the greatest concentrations in the Southeast and mid-Atlantic regions, especially Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and Maryland.
African Americans have a long history in the United States. Some African American families have been in the United States for many generations; others are recent immigrants from places such as Africa, the Caribbean, or the West Indies.

The health disparities between African Americans and other racial groups are striking and are apparent in life expectancy, infant mortality, and other measures of health status.
For example, in 1999 the average American could expect to live 77.8 years, the average African American could only expect to live 73.1 years.
Factors contributing to poor health outcomes among African Americans include discrimination, cultural barriers, and lack of access to health care.

In July 2006, 40.2 million people in the United States, or 13.4 percent of the civilian noninstitutionalized population, were Black. They are the second largest minority population, following the Hispanic/Latino population. In 2004, the majority of Blacks lived in the South (54 percent). In comparison, 67 percent (198.3 million) of the United States population was non-Hispanic White: 34 percent lived in the South. The ten states with the largest Black population in 2006 were New York, Florida, Texas, Georgia, California, Illinois, North Carolina, Maryland, Virginia, Michigan. Louisiana is no longer in the top 10, as a result of the Hurricane Katrina disaster. Combined, these 10 states represented 49% of the total Black population. Of the ten largest places in the United States with 100,000 or more population, Detroit had the largest proportion of Blacks, 83%, followed by Philadelphia (44%), and Chicago (38%).

In 2004, as compared to Whites, a lower percentage of Blacks had earned at least a high school diploma (74 percent and 81 percent, respectively). More Black women than Black men had earned at least a bachelor's degree (16 percent compared with 13 percent), while among non-Hispanic Whites, a higher proportion of men than women had earned at least a bachelor's degree (26 percent and 23 percent, respectively).

According to the 2006 Census Bureau report, the average African-American family median income was $31,969 in comparison to $52,423 for non-Hispanic Caucasian families. In 2006, the U.S. Census bureau reported that 20 percent of African-Americans in comparison to 8 percent of non-Hispanic Caucasians were living at the poverty level. In 2006, the unemployment rate for Blacks was twice that for non-Hispanic Whites (8 percent and 4 percent, respectively). This finding was consistent for both men (8 percent compared with 4 percent) and women (7 percent compared with 4 percent).

In 2004, 55 percent of African-Americans in comparison to 78non-Hispanic Caucasians used employer-sponsored health insurance. Also in 2004, 24.6 percent of African-Americans in comparison to 7.9 percent of non-Hispanic Caucasians relied on public health insurance. Finally, in 2006, 17.3 percent of African-Americans in comparison to 12 percent of non-Hispanic Caucasians were uninsured.

In 2003, the death rate for African Americans was higher than Whites for heart diseases, stroke, cancer, asthma, influenza and pneumonia, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and homicide.

Although African American children aged 19 to 35 months had comparable rates of immunization for hepatitis, influenza, MMR, and polio, they were slightly less likely to be fully immunized, when compared to non-Hispanic white children.
